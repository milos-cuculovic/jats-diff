For successful and efficient monitoring, timely data are necessary, and high flexibility makes the UAS imagery ideal for the task. Specific timing and frequent acquisition of data at very fine scales also enables targeted monitoring of rapid (interannual) changes of environmental features, including plant phenology and growth, extreme events, and hydrological processes. For these reasons, environmental studies were among the first civil applications of the technology in 1990s. Thanks to the significant cost reduction of both vehicles and sensors, and recent developments in data processing software, UAS applications have expanded rapidly in the last decade, stimulating a number of additional and complementary topics spanning full automation of single or multiple vehicles, tracking and flight control systems, hardware and software innovations, tracking of moving targets, and image correction and mapping performance assessment. The growing interest in those applications is reflected in the number of UAS-based research papers published over the last 27 years, with a focus on those being directed towards environmental monitoring (based on a search of the ISI (Internation Scientific Indexing)-web of knowledge using the keywords “UAS” or “UAV”, and “environment”). In particular, the number of applications has seen a particularly prominent increase over the last five years (-|xref ref-type="fig" rid="remotesensing-10-00641-f001"|-Figure 1-|/xref|-).</p></move><move xmlns="" at="389" move="400::404" nodecount="1" nodenumberA="400" nodenumberB="404" op="movedFrom" pos="7"><p>The dynamic nature and spatial variability of environmental processes that occur at very fine scales require data of an equivalent high spatial and temporal resolution.
