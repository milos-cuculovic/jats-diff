Introduction</title></move><move xmlns="" move="392::434" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="392" nodenumberB="434" op="movedTo"><p>Despite the recent and rapid increase in the number and range of Earth observing satellites [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-remotesensing-10-00641"|-1-|/xref|-,-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-remotesensing-10-00641"|-2-|/xref|-,-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-remotesensing-10-00641"|-3-|/xref|-], the temporal resolution and availability of current very high spatial resolution satellite sensors (less than 10 m) are generally not sufficient nor flexible enough for many quantitative remote sensing applications, and they are thus of limited use in detecting and monitoring the dynamics of surficial environmental processes. Recent advances in Earth observation (i.e., EO) are opening new opportunities for environmental monitoring at finer scales [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-remotesensing-10-00641"|-4-|/xref|-]. For instance, CubeSat platforms represent a promising satellite technology, operating predominantly in the visible to near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and provide high spatial and temporal resolution [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-remotesensing-10-00641"|-5-|/xref|-]. Nevertheless, most of these satellites are operated by commercial organizations; hence, if short revisit times are required (i.e., for high-frequency monitoring), the cost of image acquisition can become a limiting factor. While manned airborne platforms can, in principle, provide both high spatial resolution and rapid revisit times, in practice, their use is routinely limited by operational complexity, safety, logistics, and cost. Their use becomes feasible only over medium-sized areas and remains largely within the domain of commercial operators. Recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology have created an alternative monitoring platform that provides an opportunity to capture the spatial, spectral, and temporal requirements across a range of applications with relatively small investment. They offer high versatility, adaptability, and flexibility compared with manned airborne systems or satellites, and have the potential to be rapidly and repeatedly deployed for high spatial and temporal resolution data [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-remotesensing-10-00641"|-6-|/xref|-].</p></move><move xmlns="" move="394::436" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="394" nodenumberB="436" op="movedTo"><p>While UAS systems cannot compete with satellite imagery in terms of spatial coverage, they provide unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions unmatched by satellite alternatives. Furthermore, they do so at a fraction of the satellite acquisition cost if the area of interest has relatively small extent. For example, a newly tasked high-resolution natural color image (50 cm/pixel) from a satellite (e.g., GeoEye-1) can cost up to 3000 USD. On the other hand, the initial outlay to acquire a single UAS with a natural color camera can be less than 1000 USD (see -|xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-remotesensing-10-00641"|-Appendix A-|/xref|-), with this delivering a dataset of high spatial resolution (several cm/pixel). Of course, the additional benefit of the UAS platform is that the temporal resolution is limited only by the number of flights (and power supply/battery capacity), so any cost equivalence is quickly overcome due to repeatability. The costs for acquiring UAS imagery are usually derived from the initial investment, the processing software, data storage, and associated (and ongoing) fieldwork expenses. However, after the initial investment, datasets can be delivered more often and at a higher resolution than by any other EO system.</p></move><move xmlns="" move="396::438" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="396" nodenumberB="438" op="movedTo"><p>Matese et al. [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-remotesensing-10-00641"|-7-|/xref|-] provided an intercomparison of the acquisition and processing costs of three different platforms (UAS, Aircraft, and Satellite). Their cost model parametrization allows the derivation of the relative cost for the different configurations, showing that UAS is the most cost-effective solution for fields of an extent equal to or less than 20 ha. Their quantitative analyses showed that the approximate total cost of a UAS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map over a 5 ha field is equal to 400 €/ha, while satellite products may cost about 30% more.</p></move><move xmlns="" move="398::440" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="398" nodenumberB="440" op="movedTo"><p>A cost–benefit analysis for monitoring and maintaining parks facilities, such as the Deleo Regional Sports Park, identified a clear economical convenience in the use of UAS for an area with an extent of approximately 10 ha [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-remotesensing-10-00641"|-8-|/xref|-]. Of course, the theoretical limit for such economic convenience may be affected by several parameters (e.g., type of vehicle, sensors adopted, frequency of flights, and postprocessing) and this may lead to a nonunique result, but there is a general coherence in the literature that tends to identify such a limit in a lower bound between 10 and 20 ha. Over larger areas, acquisition, georeferencing, and orthorectification costs impact negatively on the economic costs of UAS-derived images.</p></move><move xmlns="" move="400::442" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="400" nodenumberB="442" op="movedTo"><p>Of course, it is not an equivalent assessment to compare these platforms on an image-by-image basis, as it is the spatiotemporal richness of the UAS systems that makes their application so transformative. Beyond allowing the high spatial and temporal resolutions needed for many applications, UAS-mounted sensors have several additional advantages which are key across a range of applications. First, they provide rapid access to environmental data, offering the near real-time capabilities required in many applications. The most mature of these is the capacity to share orthomosaic and elevation data, using both commercial and open-source alternatives [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-remotesensing-10-00641"|-9-|/xref|-]. Second, UAS satisfy safety requirements and accessibility issues for inspection of otherwise inaccessible sites or for hazard detection and monitoring [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-remotesensing-10-00641"|-10-|/xref|-]. Third, the great advantage of UAS is their capacity to collect data in cloudy or hazy conditions that would otherwise obscure satellite retrieval. Analysis of meteorological data has shown that, even with daily revisits of Earth observation satellites, the probability of operating a monitoring service based on optical satellite imagery in rainy regions is about 20%, while the probability of obtaining a usable image with UAS is between 45 and 70% [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-remotesensing-10-00641"|-11-|/xref|-]. Perhaps most importantly, operations with UAS are not limited to specific hours (as with sun-synchronous satellite sensors), and, thus, UAS can be used for continuous environmental monitoring.</p></move><move xmlns="" move="402::444" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="402" nodenumberB="444" op="movedTo"><p>These aforementioned capabilities, together with the increasing variety and affordability of both UAS and sensor technologies, have stimulated an explosion of interest from researchers across numerous domains [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-remotesensing-10-00641"|-12-|/xref|-,-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-remotesensing-10-00641"|-13-|/xref|-,-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-remotesensing-10-00641"|-14-|/xref|-,-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-remotesensing-10-00641"|-15-|/xref|-,-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-remotesensing-10-00641"|-16-|/xref|-]. Among others, Singh and Frazier [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-remotesensing-10-00641"|-17-|/xref|-] provided a detailed meta-analysis on published articles highlighting the diversity of UAS processing procedures, clearly identifying the critical need for a harmonization and standardization among the many possible strategies to acquire and preprocess data to derive UAS-based products.</p></move><move xmlns="" move="404::446" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="404" nodenumberB="446" op="movedTo"><p>The dynamic nature and spatial variability of environmental processes that occur at very fine scales require data of an equivalent high spatial and temporal resolution. For successful and efficient monitoring, timely data are necessary, and high flexibility makes the UAS imagery ideal for the task. Specific timing and frequent acquisition of data at very fine scales also enables targeted monitoring of rapid (interannual) changes of environmental features, including plant phenology and growth, extreme events, and hydrological processes. For these reasons, environmental studies were among the first civil applications of the technology in 1990s. Thanks to the significant cost reduction of both vehicles and sensors, and recent developments in data processing software, UAS applications have expanded rapidly in the last decade, stimulating a number of additional and complementary topics spanning full automation of single or multiple vehicles, tracking and flight control systems, hardware and software innovations, tracking of moving targets, and image correction and mapping performance assessment. The growing interest in those applications is reflected in the number of UAS-based research papers published over the last 27 years, with a focus on those being directed towards environmental monitoring (based on a search of the ISI (Internation Scientific Indexing)-web of knowledge using the keywords “UAS” or “UAV”, and “environment”). In particular, the number of applications has seen a particularly prominent increase over the last five years (-|xref ref-type="fig" rid="remotesensing-10-00641-f001"|-Figure 1-|/xref|-).</p></move><move xmlns="" move="406::448" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="406" nodenumberB="448" op="movedTo"><p>In addition to the increasing availability of UAS, recent advances in sensor technologies and analytical capabilities are rapidly expanding the number of potential UAS applications.
