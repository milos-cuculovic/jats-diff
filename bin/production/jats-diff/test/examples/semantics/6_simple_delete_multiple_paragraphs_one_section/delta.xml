As an example, Jeunnette and Hart [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-remotesensing-10-00641"|-24-|/xref|-] developed a parametric numerical model to compare aerial platform options (UAS vs airborne) to support agriculture in developing countries characterized by highly fragmented fields, but manned systems are still more competitive from an operational and cost/efficiency point of view because of the present limitations in altitude, distance, and speed of UAS. In particular, UAS become cost-competitive when they are allowed to fly higher than 300 m AGL (above ground level), while current limits are set around 120â€“150 m. This is a critical limitation for the use of UAS along with the fact that flights should be within visible line of sight (VLOS) in many jurisdictions.</p></delete><delete xmlns="" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="195"><p>All the applications described highlight the potential use of UAS in developing advanced tools for precision agriculture applications and for vegetation monitoring in general. With time, both technological advances and legislation will evolve and likely converge, further advancing the efficient use of such technologies.</p></delete></ndiff>
