This has been underpinned by the development of SfM software, which offers a user-friendly and low-cost alternative to conventional digital photogrammetric processing. This includes proprietary structure-from-motion (SfM) software such as Agisoft Photoscan and Pix4D, which is significantly more affordable than most conventional photogrammetric software. Moreover, there has also been development of open source SfM software, including VisualSfM, Bundler, Apero-MicMac, OpenDroneMap, etc. Nevertheless, although different and efficient software solutions are available, the computational cost of the elaboration is critical and it can require several days of data processing. Cloud-based platforms such as DroneDeploy or DroneMapper offer the possibility to integrate and share aerial data, but also to derive orthomosaics with light processing workloads.
