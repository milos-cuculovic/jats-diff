==============================================================================
Done since 0.18 release

*** Building
- improvements and fixes to build.xml (ASandstrom,KCampbell)

*** General
- Changes to support Batik (KLiddle)
{ FOP now uses Batik to render svg
This is handled for awt - using batik to render to a graphic
and pdf.
Pdf still requires better image support.
The elements and properties are generated from the svgelements.xml
document.
The version of batik is 17/05/2001 cvs. }
- memory buffering (Seshadri G.K.)

*** Examples
- Added Norwegian hyphenation based on Rune Kleveland's original
nohyphb.tex TeX patterns from the ispell-norsk-2.0 package (TEngvig)
adds Danish text (Lars Michael Johnsen)
- fixed up fills and borders for better appearance (KLiddle)
- Fixed basic-link horizontal position with justification turned on. (KCampbell)
- add border-collapse property (KLease)
- Added CID Font example (KCampbell)

*** Hyphenation
- corrected danish hyphenation (Carlos Villegas)
- adds Danish hyphenation file (Carlos Villegas)
- Added Norwegian hyphenation based on Rune Kleveland's original
nohyphb.tex TeX patterns from the ispell-norsk-2.0 package (TEngvig)
- Hyphenation patterns for russian (TEngvig)

*** codegen
- The elements and properties are generated from the svgelements.xml
document. (KLiddle)

*** Package org.apache.fop.apps:
- support for XMLRenderer (ASandstrom)
- Removed uses of System.out where throwing a FOPException should suffice.
Refactored code to throw FOPExceptions so embedding FOP wont' cause app
server JVMs to exit. (KCampbell)
- adding -text and -pcl options to help text (FJannidis)
- sets baseDir to a URL string rather than a file path string (KLiddle)

*** Package org.apache.fop.datatypes:
- New datatype to represent the property border-separation (KLease)

*** Package org.apache.fop.fo:
- fixed a couple of problems when placing foreign objects near
page break (KLiddle)
- Support for LengthPair property type (KLease)
- restored support for external svg images (KLiddle)

*** Package org.apache.fop.fo.flow:
- inlining of images (ASandstrom, Seshadri G.K.)
- footnote height problem fix (KLiddle)
- fixed a couple of problems when placing foreign objects near
page break (KLiddle)
- added support for 'number-columns-repeated' (G. Pretterhofer)
- fixes a null pointer ex if area is removed before creating area (KLiddle)
- footnote height/id reference problem fixes (KLiddle)
- Fix body positioning; remove widow and orphan handling for rows (KLease)
- Make borders closer to CR spec (KLease)
- Improves cell borders when border-collapse=collapse (the default). Note that
this doesn't implement the full CR, but it's a big improvement and will handle
many common cases. (KLease)
- Stop tables from breaking too early, but make sure that all cells are
composed with the same maxHeight and that absolute Height is set correctly.
In TableRow.java, remove old commented out stuff and put back space-before
(for now) and fix a potential bug involving space-before. (KLease)
- Overflows may cause a row to be re-laid out, need to skip cell content
that has already been processed. (AWelch)
- Put back background on table-column and table-cell (KLease)
- increasing padding problem fix (KLiddle)
- Each column in the row should start with the same height available. (AWelch)
- For borders to be drawn properly on overflowed rows must process all
children. (AWelch)
- Use Constants values. (KLease)

*** Package org.apache.fop.fo.pagination:
- running page num ctr now instance variable for servlet use (KLiddle)
- Made logging go to the same stream (out) for pages and the newline
after a page sequence. The newline was previously going to the err stream.
(KCampbell)

*** Package org.apache.fop.fonts:
- Patch from westbay@seaple.icc.ne.jp to use unicode escape char instead of
pound sign because it was interpreted as an invalid double byte char in
Japanese locale (ja_JP.EUC) and wouldn't compile. (TEngvig)
- Fixes a signedness bug in handling cmaps that caused some fonts to be
invalid. (TEngvig)
- Some fonts contains malformed composite glyphs which used to make fop crash.
This adds an errormessage and tries to embed the font without the composite
glyph. (TEngvig)
- Made some tables in the TTF embedding optional to be compatible with more
fonts. This adheres to the TrueType spec, and makes the MS OpenType
extras optional. (KCampbell)
- Bugfix for font headers with long datatype (KCampbell)

*** Package org.apache.fop.fonts.apps:
- Fixes NumberFormatExceptions when reading .pfm files with kerning values.
(TEngvig)

- inlining of images (ASandstrom, Seshadri G.K.)
- restored support for external svg images (KLiddle)
- gives SVGReader the correct size (KLiddle)

*** Package org.apache.fop.layout:
- Fix table breaking bug (KLease)
- (AreaContainer) Remove offset of X and Y position by border and
padding (KLease)
- (FontInfo, FontState) Refactored FontState so it doesn't do excessive font
lookups per character. (KCampbell)

- (basic-link) Fixed basic-link horizontal position with justification
turned on. (KCampbell)

to crash (TEngvig)

*** Package org.apache.fop.layout.inline:
- Fixed basic-link horizontal position with justification turned on. (Campbell)

*** Package org.apache.fop.pdf:
- Changed encoding of CID fonts from customized CMap to predefined Identity-H
encoding. (TEngvig)
- Fixed some bugs in PDF rendering when font embedding fails.
FontDescriptor is now written out anyway to produce a valid PDF
and acrobat reports that the font can't be displayed. (KCampbell)
- Added default producer to fix a bug where the PDF producer is
set to null in the default commandline usage. (KCampbell)
- (PrintRenderer) Correct border positions on absolutely positioned
AreaContainers (fo:block-container) (KLease)

a little. (KCampbell)
