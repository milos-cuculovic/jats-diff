FOP Servlet Readme

This directory contains two sample servlets that use FOP:

- FopServlet can take a XSL:FO file or a XML+XSLT as parameters to create a PDF
that is being shown in the browser.

- FopPrintServlet has the same parameters but prints the generated document to
the default printer instead of generating a PDF.

Creating the WAR file:

1. Run build.bat (on Windows) or build.sh (on Unix) to create the WAR file.
2. Deploy the WAR file in your favourite web container.
