    What is FOP?
    FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
    objects. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object
    tree conforming to the XSL-FO Version 1.0 W3C Recommendation and 
    then turns it into a PDF document or allows you to preview it 
    directly on screen.
