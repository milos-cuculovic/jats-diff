      <abstract>
        <p>Environmental <b>monitoring</b> plays a central role in diagnosing climate and management hello impacts on natural and agricultural systems; enhancing the understanding of hydrological processes; optimizing the allocation and distribution of water resources; and assessing, forecasting, and even preventing natural disasters. Nowadays, most monitoring and data collection systems are based upon a combination of ground-based measurements, manned airborne sensors, and satellite observations. These data are utilized in describing both small- and large-scale processes, but have spatiotemporal constraints inherent to each respective collection system. Bridging the unique spatial and temporal divides that limit current monitoring platforms is key to improving our understanding of environmental systems. In this context, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have considerable potential to radically improve environmental monitoring. UAS-mounted sensors offer an extraordinary opportunity to bridge the existing gap between field observations and traditional air- and space-borne remote sensing, by providing high spatial detail over relatively large areas in a cost-effective way and an entirely new capacity for enhanced temporal retrieval. As well as showcasing recent advances in the field, there is also a need to identify and understand the potential limitations of UAS technology. For these platforms to reach their monitoring potential, a wide spectrum of unresolved issues and application-specific challenges require focused community attention. Indeed, to leverage the full potential of UAS-based approaches, sensing technologies, measurement protocols, postprocessing techniques, retrieval <i>algorithms</i>, and evaluation techniques need to be harmonized. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing research and applications of UAS in natural and agricultural ecosystem monitoring in order to identify future directions, applications, developments, and challenges.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite the recent and rapid increase in the number and range of Earth observing satellites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-remotesensing-10-00641">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-remotesensing-10-00641">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-remotesensing-10-00641">3</xref>], the temporal resolution and availability of current very high spatial resolution satellite sensors (less than 10 m) are generally not sufficient nor flexible enough for many quantitative remote sensing applications, and they are thus of limited use in detecting and monitoring the dynamics of surficial environmental processes. Recent advances in Earth observation (i.e., EO) are opening new opportunities for environmental monitoring at finer scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-remotesensing-10-00641">4</xref>]. For instance, CubeSat platforms represent a promising satellite technology, operating predominantly in the visible to near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and provide high spatial and temporal resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-remotesensing-10-00641">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, most of these satellites are operated by commercial organizations; hence, if short revisit times are required (i.e., for high-frequency monitoring), the cost of image acquisition can become a limiting factor. While manned airborne platforms can, in principle, provide both high spatial resolution and rapid revisit times, in practice, their use is routinely limited by operational complexity, safety, logistics, and cost. Their use becomes feasible only over medium-sized areas and remains largely within the domain of commercial operators. Recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology have created an alternative monitoring platform that provides an opportunity to capture the spatial, spectral, and temporal requirements across a range of applications with relatively small investment. They offer high versatility, adaptability, and flexibility compared with manned airborne systems or satellites, and have the potential to be rapidly and repeatedly deployed for high spatial and temporal resolution data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-remotesensing-10-00641">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>While UAS systems cannot compete with satellite imagery in terms of spatial coverage, they provide unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions unmatched by satellite alternatives. Furthermore, they do so at a fraction of the satellite acquisition cost if the area of interest has relatively small extent. For example, a newly tasked high-resolution natural color image (50 cm/pixel) from a satellite (e.g., GeoEye-1) can cost up to 3000 USD. On the other hand, the initial outlay to acquire a single UAS with a natural color camera can be less than 1000 USD (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-remotesensing-10-00641">Appendix A</xref>), with this delivering a dataset of high spatial resolution (several cm/pixel). Of course, the additional benefit of the UAS platform is that the temporal resolution is limited only by the number of flights (and power supply/battery capacity), so any cost equivalence is quickly overcome due to repeatability. The costs for acquiring UAS imagery are usually derived from the initial investment, the processing software, data storage, and associated (and ongoing) fieldwork expenses. However, after the initial investment, datasets can be delivered more often and at a higher resolution than by any other EO system.</p>
      <p>Matese et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-remotesensing-10-00641">7</xref>] provided an intercomparison of the acquisition and processing costs of three different platforms (UAS, Aircraft, and Satellite). Their cost model parametrization allows the derivation of the relative cost for the different configurations, showing that UAS is the most cost-effective solution for fields of an extent equal to or less than 20 ha. Their quantitative analyses showed that the approximate total cost of a UAS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map over a 5 ha field is equal to 400 &#x20AC;/ha, while satellite products may cost about 30% more.</p>

      <title>2. Data Collection, Processing, and Limitations</title>
      <p>While offering an unprecedented platform to advance spatiotemporal insights across the Earth and environmental sciences, UAS are not without their own operational, processing, and retrieval problems. These range from image blur due to the forward motion of the platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-remotesensing-10-00641">34</xref>], resolution impacts due to variable flying height, orthorectification issues and geometric distortion associated with inadequate image overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-remotesensing-10-00641">35</xref>], and the spectral effects induced by variable illumination during flight. These and other factors can all affect the subsequent quality of any orthorectified image and, subsequently, the derived products. These are well described in a recent review paper by Whitehead and Hugenholtz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-remotesensing-10-00641">13</xref>]. As such, it is essential to consider best practice in the context of (a) mission and flight planning; (b) preflight camera/sensor configuration; (c) in-flight data collection; (d) ground control/ radiometric calibration and correction; (e) geometric and atmospheric corrections; (f) orthorectification and image mosaicking; and (g) extracting relevant products/metrics for remote sensing application. Items (a) and (b) are preflight tasks, (c) and (d) are conducted in the field at the time of survey, and (e)&#x2013;(g) are postsurvey tasks. Together, these aspects are crucial to data acquisition and postprocessing, which deliver the necessary starting point for subsequent application-specific analysis. However, despite the existence of well-established workflows in photogrammetry, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing to address such fundamental aspects, UAS systems introduce various additional complexities, which to date have not been thoroughly addressed. Consequently, best practice workflows for producing high-quality remote sensing products from UAS are still lacking, and further studies that focus on validating UAS-collected measurements with robust processing methods are important for improving the final quality of the processed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-remotesensing-10-00641">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-remotesensing-10-00641">37</xref>].</p>

        <title>2.1. Preflight Planning</title>
        <p>Flight or mission planning is the first essential step for UAS data acquisition and has a profound impact on the data acquired and the processing workflow. Similar to other remote sensing approaches, a host of parameters must be considered before the actual flight, such as platform specifications, the extent of the study site (area-of-interest), ground sampling distance, payload characteristics, topography of the study site, goals of the study, meteorological forecasts, and local flight regulations. UAS have additional aspects that require further consideration, including the skill level of the pilot, platform characteristics, and actual environmental flight conditions&#x2014;all of which affect the data characteristics and subsequent phases of processing.</p>
        <p>Due to the proliferation of low-cost, off-the-shelf digital cameras, photogrammetry has been the primary implementation of UAS. James and Robson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-remotesensing-10-00641">38</xref>] highlighted how unresolved elements of the camera model (lens distortion) can propagate as errors in UAS-DEMs (derived digital elevation models), and how this can be addressed by incorporating oblique images. Other studies have highlighted the importance of flight line configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-remotesensing-10-00641">39</xref>], as well as minimizing image blur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-remotesensing-10-00641">34</xref>]. There is a need to consolidate this evidence to develop best practice guidance for optimizing UAS SfM (structure-from-motion) measurement quality, whilst maintaining ease of use and accessibility.</p>
        <p>Accurate absolute orientation (georeferencing) is an important element for UAS surveys, and is fundamental for any multitemporal monitoring or comparison to other datasets. This task is often referred to as registration, and is conventionally dependent on establishing ground control points (GCPs) which are fixed by a higher-order control method (usually Global Navigation Satellite System&#x2014;GNSS or Global Positioning System). A number of studies have examined the effect of GCP networks (number and distribution) in UAS surveys, showing that significant errors are expected in SfM-based products where GCPs are not adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-remotesensing-10-00641">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-remotesensing-10-00641">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, systematic DEM error can be significantly reduced by including properly defined GCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-remotesensing-10-00641">41</xref>] or incorporating oblique images in the absence of GCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-remotesensing-10-00641">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>Best practice can also be drawn from manned aerial photogrammetry. Direct georeferencing is standard practice in aerial photogrammetry, where the position and orientation of the platform are precisely determined using on-board survey-grade differential GNSS and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data combined through an inertial navigation system (INS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-remotesensing-10-00641">42</xref>]. This allows the camera station (exposure) position and orientation to be derived directly, thus eliminating or minimizing the need for ground control points. Therefore, as discussed by Colomina and Molina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-remotesensing-10-00641">35</xref>], there is an increasing drive towards achieving centimeter-level direct georeferencing for UAS using alternative GNSS/IMU configurations, precise point positioning (PPP), and dual-frequency GNSS.</p>

      <title>3. Monitoring Agricultural and Natural Ecosystems</title>
      <p>Natural and agricultural ecosystems are influenced by climatic forcing, physical characteristics, and management practices that are highly variable in both time and space. Moreover, vegetation state changes can often occur within a short period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60-remotesensing-10-00641">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61-remotesensing-10-00641">61</xref>] due to unfavorable growing conditions or climatic extremes (e.g., heat waves, heavy storms, etc.).
