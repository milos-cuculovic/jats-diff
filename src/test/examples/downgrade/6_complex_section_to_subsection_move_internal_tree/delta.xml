A detailed description of such variables will increase our capacity to describe water resource availability and assist agricultural and ecosystem management. Our manuscript provides an overview of some of the recent applications in field-based UAS surficial environmental monitoring. The wide range of applications testifies to the great potential of these techniques, but, at the same time, the variety of methodologies adopted is evidence that there is still need for harmonization efforts. The variety of available platforms, sensors, and specificity of any particular case study have stimulated a proliferation of a huge number of specific algorithms addressing flight planning, image registration, calibration and correction, and derivation of indices or variables.

However, this is one of the reasons why there is much potential for further improvements in the technology and its use. One particular benefit of UAV improvements is related to the potential benefit that could be directed towards satellite-based observations, which can leverage the utilization of highly detailed UAS data. Given the spatiotemporal advantage of UAS systems, they can provide much higher return periods, offering several flights per day to study very dynamic processes at high spatial resolution, such as physiological response of vegetation to heat or even rapid flooding events. The combination of these data allows an advanced satellite test-bed for examining scale effects due to spatial resolution, identifying the most suitable acquisition time, establishing the effects of temporal resolution, incorporating suitable spectral bands, and establishing needed radiometric resolution, etc., all of which provide feedback to developing improved space-borne platforms in a way that ground-based monitoring alone can never replicate. Moreover, the capability to achieve a resolution comparable with the scale of field measurements gives the opportunity to address the issue of within-pixel spatial heterogeneity observed by satellites.</p></move><move xmlns="" move="577::510" nodecount="21" nodenumberA="577" nodenumberB="510" op="movedTo"><p>With time, natural selection will likely deliver the most efficient collection and processing solutions for different contexts and applications, but there is still a significant amount of work needed to drive this change. Therefore, a major challenge for the scientific community is to foster this process by providing some guidance in the wide range of possibilities offered by the market. On the other side of this, the private sector of UAS developers are also investing in this field, accelerating the evolution of the technology. Among the many advances, it is interesting to mention the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>One of the aspects directly impacting the area that is able to be sensed is the limited flight times of UAS. This problem is currently managed by mission planning that enables management of multiple flights. Technology is also offering new solutions that will extend the flight endurance up to several hours, making the use of UAS more competitive. For instance, new developments in batteries suggest that the relatively short flying time imposed by current capacity will be significantly improved in the future [-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156-remotesensing-10-00641"|-156-|/xref|-]. In this context, another innovation introduced in the most recent vehicles is an integrated energy supply system connected with onboard solar panels that allow flight endurance to be extended from 40–50 min up to 5 h, depending on the platform.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The relative ground sampling distance affects the quality of the surveys, but is often not compensated for. This limitation can now be solved by implementing 3D flight paths that follow the surface in order to maintain a uniform GSD. Currently, only a few software suites (e.g., UgCS, eMotion 3) use digital terrain models to adjust the height path of the mission in order to maintain consistent GSD.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The influence of GSD may be reduced by increasing flight height, making UAS even more cost-competitive (by increasing sensed areas), but current legislation in many jurisdictions limits this to between 120 and 150 m and to within visible line of sight (VLOS). In this context, the development of microdrones will significantly reduce risk associated with their use, and relax some of the constraints due to safety requirements.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recent and rapid developments in sensor miniaturization, standardization, and cost reduction have opened new possibilities for UAS applications. However, limits remain, especially for commercial readymade platforms that are used the most among the scientific community.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sensor calibration remains an issue, especially for hyperspectral sensors. For example, vegetation can be measured in its state and distribution using RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal cameras, as well as with LiDAR.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Image registration, correction, and calibration remain major challenges. The vulnerability of UAS to weather conditions (wind, rain) and the geometric and radiometric limitations of current lightweight sensors have stimulated the development of new algorithms for image mosaicking and correction. In this context, the development of open source and commercial SfM software allows image mosaicking to be addressed, but radiometric correction and calibration is still an open question that may find a potential solution through experience with EO. Moreover, the development of new mapping-quality cameras has already significantly improved spatial registration and will likely help to also improve the overall quality of the UAS imagery.</p></list-item></list></p></move><move xmlns="" move="598::531" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="598" nodenumberB="531" op="movedTo"><p>Technological advances are strongly supporting the diffusion of these technologies over a wide range of fields, including hydrology. On the other hand, the research community must address significant challenges in standardizing the methodologies adopted. All environmental variables (e.g., vegetation, soil moisture, and river flow) can be measured using different sensors and algorithms, but a comprehensive assessment of the performances of each of these methods and procedures is required. Such efforts may help to improve our capacity in describing the spatiotemporal processes at both the field and the river basin scale.
