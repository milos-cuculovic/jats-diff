[-|xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-remotesensing-10-00641"|-7-|/xref|-] provided an intercomparison of the acquisition and processing costs of three different platforms (UAS, Aircraft, and Satellite). Their cost model parametrization allows the derivation of the relative cost for the different configurations, showing that UAS is the most cost-effective solution for fields of an extent equal to or less than 20 ha. Their quantitative analyses showed that the approximate total cost of a UAS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map over a 5 ha field is equal to 400 €/ha, while satellite products may cost about 30% more.</p></delete><delete xmlns="" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="157"><p>Flight or mission planning is the first essential step for UAS data acquisition and has a profound impact on the data acquired and the processing workflow. Similar to other remote sensing approaches, a host of parameters must be considered before the actual flight, such as platform specifications, the extent of the study site (area-of-interest), ground sampling distance, payload characteristics, topography of the study site, goals of the study, meteorological forecasts, and local flight regulations. UAS have additional aspects that require further consideration, including the skill level of the pilot, platform characteristics, and actual environmental flight conditions—all of which affect the data characteristics and subsequent phases of processing.</p></delete><delete xmlns="" nodecount="2" nodenumberA="195"><p>All the applications described highlight the potential use of UAS in developing advanced tools for precision agriculture applications and for vegetation monitoring in general. With time, both technological advances and legislation will evolve and likely converge, further advancing the efficient use of such technologies.</p></delete></ndiff>
