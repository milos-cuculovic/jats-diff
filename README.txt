The jats-diff project is managed by ANT.

The ANT buildfile has been provided to reduce the burden of compiling jats-diff files and
execute other tasks (generate documentation, execute tests, package full releases, etc.)

If you haven't got apache-ant installed on your computer, just follow these simple steps:
 - Linux: using your packet manager (apt, pacman, ecc..) install the apache-ant package
       apt-get install ant (Ubuntu, Debian, .. )
       pacman -S apache-ant (Archlinux)
 - MacOS X: first install brew (a package manager for OS X) and then install ant
       ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
       brew install ant 
 - Windows: more information are provided here: http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html


Just open up a terminal and execute the 'ant' command in the root directory 
of the jats-diff release and you will be shown the list of available tasks.


Enjoy!
