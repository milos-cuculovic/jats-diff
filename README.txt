The JNDiff project is managed by ANT.

The ANT buildfile has been provided to reduce the burden of compiling JNdiff files and 
execute other tasks (generate documentation, execute tests, package full releases, etc.)

If you haven't got apache-ant installed on your computer, just follow these simple steps:
 - Linux: using your packet manager (apt, pacman, ecc..) install the apache-ant package
       apt-get install ant (Ubuntu, Debian, .. )
       pacman -S apache-ant (Archlinux)
 - MacOS X: first install brew (a package manager for OS X) and then install ant
       ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
       brew install ant 
 - Windows: more information are provided here: http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html


Just open up a terminal and execute the 'ant' command in the root directory 
of the JNDiff release and you will be shown the list of available tasks.


Enjoy!
